## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This salary calculator creates a table of information based on correlated inputs on the page. The user can enter information, edit their entries, and delete their entries. The data is stored in the browser's local storage.

The form displaing employee data can be sorted in ascending or descending order alphabetically or numerically depending on the data type.

The salary calculator calculates the total monthly salary expenses based on the entries in the table. The user can set a custom monthly budget. If the monthly expenses exceed the monthly budget the user is notified by the monthly expense amount turning red.
